# practical-tdd
A truly practical approach to the fundamentals of test driven development in Java, featuring JUnit and Mockito

### What is TDD?
Tests drive the code.

Red -> Green -> Refactor
1. A new test will initially fail
2. We work to get the test to pass
3. We finally optimise our code, and tests

### What to test?
Each test will cover a single scenario for a single piece of logic.
